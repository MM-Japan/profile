          Hey there, wanderer! I'm Godfrey, the First Elden Lord, but you can call me Hoarah Loux if you're feeling fancy. Once upon a time, I was the big cheese around here, swinging my axe and looking all majestic with my golden mane. Life was pretty sweet, ruling the Lands Between and all.
          But guess what? They kicked me out! Can you believe it? 'Godfrey, you need a vacation,' they said. So, here I am, roaming around, looking for adventure, and maybe a snack. Have you tried the local lambas bread? It's to die for!
          These days, I like to keep things casualâ€”no more heavy crowns or royal decrees. Just me, my axe, and the occasional dragon to wrestle. Oh, and don't get me started on the Golden Order. I mean, shiny armor is great and all, but have you ever tried fighting in it? Talk about chafing!
          Anyway, if you see a big, golden-haired guy wandering around, say hi! I promise I won't bite... much. Just kidding! Or am I? You'll have to find out. See you around, champ!
